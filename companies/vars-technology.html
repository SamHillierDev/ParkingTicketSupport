                <p>We can help you avoid having to pay VARS Technology. A PCN is a ticket issued by a Private Parking Firm, these are often called parking charge notices. They are also referred to as fines</p>
                <p>We have the legal knowledge and industry background built over many years in order to beat VARS Technology. This enables us to use the most appropriate appeal option in order to win your appeal. We never use mitigation in parking appeals.</p>

                        <li>An Appeal is logged at www.popla.co.uk</li>
                        <li>Evidence and reasons for appeal are logged in one go. There is no second chance.</li>
                        <li>POPLA will then receive the evidence from the parking company and you will have a chance to comment on the evidence.</li>
                        <li>A decision will then be made by POPLA. The decision is binding on the operator but not on the motorist.</li>
                        <li>If no evidence is logged by the operator within 21 days then the appeal is upheld and the motorist wins by default.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                        <li>The IAS will then receive the evidence from the parking company and you will have a chance to comment on the evidence. This is what they call their Prima Facia case. You can then send this back to the operator comment or straight to arbitration</li>
                        <li>A decision will then be made by the IAS. The decision is binding on the operator but not on the motorist.</li>
                        <li>If no evidence is logged by the operator within 8 days then the appeal is upheld and the motorist wins by default.</li>

                <p>VARS Technology manage a large number of car parks across the UK and are members of an accredited trade association. The trade association produce a set of rules which a parking company should abide by.</p>
                
                <p>Since 2012 through the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 parking companies have been able to hold keepers liable for the actions of drivers</p>
                
                <p>In 2015 the supreme court decided the parking charge levied by parking firms was legitimate and enforceable through the courts.</p>

                <h2>How Did VARS Technology get my data from the DVLA?</h2>
                <p>In order for a parking company to obtain data from the DVLA they must belong to one of two trade associations. These are either the International Parking Community (IPC) or the British Parking Association</p>
                
                <p>The parking company can then look up the data of the keeper a fee of £2.50. This is done under the Kadoe Contract</p>
